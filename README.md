# Vulnerability Scanning Tool

This Python tool automates vulnerability scanning for security-related functions using the `nmap` library (through the `python-nmap` package). It scans a specified IP range and provides information about open ports, services, and version information. The tool can be customized to add more security checks and rules according to your needs.

## Installation

To use this tool, you need to have Python installed. You also need to install the `python-nmap` package:

```bash
pip install python-nmap
```

## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the Python script:

```bash
python vulnerability_scanner.py
```

By default, the tool scans the IP range `192.168.1.0/24`. You can customize the IP range in the script according to your requirements.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Scans the specified IP range and identifies open ports, services, and version information.
- **Port Information**: Provides information about each open port, including state, service name, and version.
- **Customizable**: Add additional security checks and rules according to your needs.

## Configuration

- **IP Range**: Customize the IP range in the script by updating the `ip_range` variable in the `main()` function.
- **Nmap Arguments**: Customize the Nmap scan options by updating the `arguments` parameter in the `vulnerability_scan()` function.

## Customization

The tool can be customized to suit your specific security needs:

- Add additional security checks within the `vulnerability_scan()` function.
- Implement more sophisticated analysis and alerting mechanisms based on scan results.

## Disclaimer

- **Legal and Ethical Use**: Use this tool responsibly and only scan networks and systems you have explicit permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.
- **Privacy and Security**: Always keep in mind the privacy and security of the systems and networks you are scanning.
- **No Warranty**: This tool is provided as-is without any warranty. Use it at your own risk.
